        <h1>The History of Diabetes</h1>
        <p>Diabetes has a long and complex history, dating back thousands of years. Here are some key milestones:</p>
        
        <h2>Early Discoveries:</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>1970s: Development of home blood glucose monitoring devices.</li>
            <li>1980s: Introduction of synthetic insulin analogs with improved properties.</li>
            <li>2000s: Emergence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems and insulin pumps.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Current Challenges:</h2>
        <p>Despite significant advancements, diabetes remains a major health challenge worldwide. Rising rates of obesity and sedentary lifestyles contribute to the increasing prevalence of diabetes.</p>
